Scheme Functions
===================
This is a repo about scheme funcions which could be used in other projects. Allmost all the functions come from the textbook `Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs`, and I have taken note for this book, you can read this note from this [link.](http://lizec.top/2017/09/01/%E3%80%8ASICP%E3%80%8B%E8%AF%BB%E4%B9%A6%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0/) The following is a part of this note.

## About This Book
`Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs`(also named as  `SICP`) is a textbook about the principles of computer programming,such as abstraction in programming, metalinguistic abstracion, recursion, interpreters, and modular programming. It is widely considered a classic text in computer science. SCIP focuses on finding general patterns from specific problem and building software tools that embody each pattern.

## How to Use Edwin
When I first tried to learn Sheme, I had a lot of problem about how to use the interpreter. One of the main reason is that Edwin is an Emacs-like editor, which is not easy for beginner to use. Therefore, I want to give an outline of Edwin. Edwin is an Emace-like editor, that is, all the usages of Edwin are almost same as Emacs. Emacs is a famous editor in Linux platforms and almost all the commands used by Emacs are begin with Ctrl key or Alt key.Now I give some the most used commands to help beginner to use Edwin. In the following, the prefix `C-` refers to the Ctrl key. For example, `C-x` means to simultaneously press the `Ctrl` key and the `x` key.

command  | means
:--------|:-------------------------------------
C-x c    | close Edwin and back to interpreter
M-z		 | evalute the expression
C-i		 | auto indent
M-/		 | auto complete
C-x C-s  | save this file
C-x C-f  | open a new file
C-x o    | switching windows
C-x 0    | close this windows

For more commands, You can read the article written by me [<<Edwin笔记>>](http://lizec.top/2017/08/04/Edwin%E7%AC%94%E8%AE%B0/)
